Plugin Version @PLUGIN_VERSION@

Revised on November 30, 2022

[NOTE]
====
In an effort to streamline workflows and improve user experience, CloudBees will be phasing out EC-Azure in favor of a new Azure CLI plugin. The phase-out will start with the CloudBees CD/RO 10.11 release, where we will stop providing new feature support and patches for EC-Azure. The Azure-CLI plugin will be released shortly after.

We suggest you transition from using EC-Azure and EC-AzureDevops to Azure-CLI as soon as it is available, to maintain new feature support and patch integration.
====


[[Integrated_Version]]
== Integrated version

This plugin was developed and tested against Windows Azure 2012.

{PRODUCT} minimum version 4.0

[[Windows_Certificates]]
== Working with Windows certificates

Azure procedures may require a Windows certificate to authenticate requests. To create and upload a certificate to Windows Azure:

. Generate an X.509 certificate using the Certificate Creation Tool (Makecert.exe) using the follow command:
+
`makecert -sky exchange -r -n "CN=<CertificateName>" -pe -a sha1 -len 2048 -ss My "D:/<CertificateName>.cer"`
+
NOTE: Makecert.exe is included with Visual Studio and Windows SDK installations. For more information, refer to link:http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bfsktky3(VS.80).aspx[Microsoft's Makecert.exe page].

. To upload the Windows certificate to Windows Azure, refer to link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate/[Configuring TLS for an application in Azure].

[[Plugin_Configuration]]
== Plugin configuration

Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply across some or all of the plugin's procedures. They are intended to reduce repetition of common values, create predefined sets of parameters for end users, and to securely store credentials where needed. Each configuration is given a unique name that is entered in designated parameters on procedures that use them.


Plugin configurations are created by going to the {PRODUCT} "Administration" tab, then to the "Plugins" sub-tab. On the right side of the line for the EC-Azure plugin, there is a "Configure" link which will open the Configuration page.

Subscription ID must be created and an X.509 management certificate needs to be uploaded to the certificate store. You can do this using the link:https://www.windowsazure.com[Management Portal]

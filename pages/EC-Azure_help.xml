    <!-- The tool description should answer these kinds of questions:
What is the tool itself is used for in the development
process? Who would use this tool? What is the general use-case or
problem that this tool solves? Look at the tool's documentation or
website(s) to get their own descriptions. Look at Wikipedia or other
outside websites. If there is a Hudson plugin, read their
documentation for ideas, examples, etc. It's OK to copy word-for-word
only if appropriate, such as FOSS - but not commercial software.

    <p>The Azure Services Platform (Azure) is an internet-scale
    cloud services platform hosted in Microsoft data centers, which
    provides an operating system and a set of developer services
    that can be used individually or together. Azure's flexible and
    interoperable platform can be used to build new applications to
    run from the cloud or enhance existing applications with
    cloud-based capabilities. Its open architecture gives
    developers the choice to build web applications, applications
    running on connected devices, PCs, servers, or hybrid
    solutions.</p>

    <p>The Azure Services Platform can be used both by applications
    running in the cloud and by applications running on local
    systems.</p>

    <p>Azure provides an open, standards-based and interoperable
    environment with support for multiple internet protocols,
    including HTTP, REST, SOAP, and XML.</p>

    <h2>Windows Azure Links</h2>

    <p>More information can be found at <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/">Windows Azure website</a>
    or at <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/">Azure
    Developer Center</a>.</p>

    API References for Windows Azure</a>.</p>

    <h2>ElectricFlow Integration to Windows Azure</h2>
    <!-- The integration description should answer the questions:
How deep does our integration go? Why should I care? What general
functionality does the plugin include? What functionality does
the plugin omit?
-->

    <p>The plugin communicates with Windows Azure through Windows
    Azure Service Management and Storage Services REST application
    programming interfaces (API) which provides programmatic access
    to much of the functionality available through the Management
    Portal using a RESTful application development style. Using the
    Service Management API, you can manage your storage accounts
    and hosted services, your service deployments, and your
    affinity groups while Storage Services API offer developers a
    means to access the Blob, Queue, and Table services in Windows
    Azure or in the development environment. EC-Azure plugin allows
    users to automate and perform operations on Windows Azure
    providing a more generic interface for managing
    deployments.</p>

    <p>All Service Management API operations are performed over SSL
    and mutually authenticated using X.509 v3 certificates.</p>

    <p>The plugin interact with Windows Azure APIs using PERL and a
    Console Application to perform the following tasks:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create configuration to hold connection information.</li>

      <li>Create and Delete Hosted Services, Storage Accounts,
      Containers and Blobs.</li>

      <li>Perform operations on Storage Accounts and
      Deployments</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Integrated Version</h2>

    <p>This plugin was developed and tested against Windows Azure
    2012.</p>

    <p>ElectricFlow minimum version 4.0</p>

    <h2>Windows Certificates</h2>

    <p>Some procedures require a certificate to authenticate the
    request, you need to create one and upload it to Windows
    Azure:</p>

    <h3>Create a X509 certificate</h3>

    <p>Using Certificate Creation Tool (Makecert.exe): makecert
    -sky exchange -r -n "CN=&lt;CertificateName&gt;" -pe -a sha1
    -len 2048 -ss My "D:/&lt;CertificateName&gt;.cer"</p>

    <p>For more information: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bfsktky3(VS.80).aspx">Makecert</a>.</p>

    <h3>Upload the certificate</h3>

    <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/gg551726">
    How to Add a Management Certificate to a Windows Azure
    Subscription</a>.</p>

    <p><b>IMPORTANT</b><br />
    In some cases if ElectricFlow is running as the local
    system account you need to create an upload the certificate to
    'nt authority/system' certificate store.<br />
    You must become 'authority/system':</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Open the cmd.exe and execute the following
      commands:<br />
      $ sc /?<br />
      $ n $ sc create syscmd binpath= "cmd /K start" type= own
      type= interact<br />
      $ whoami<br />
      $ sc start syscmd</li>

      <li>A popup message will appear, click 'Show message'.</li>

      <li>Now create the certificate using makecert and upload it
      to Azure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Plugin Procedures</h1>

    <p>IMPORTANT: For all parameter descriptions below, required
    parameters are shown in <span class="required">bold
    italics</span>.</p>

    <div id="CreateConfiguration"><a name="CreateConfiguration" id="CreateConfiguration"></a>

    <h3>Plugin Configuration</h3>
    <!-- If the plugin has separate configurations then include this section,
otherwise omit this whole section. We don't need to have a configuration
section that just says "There is no configuration for this plugin."
-->

    <p>Plugin configurations are sets of parameters that apply
    across some or all of the plugin's procedures. They are
    intended to reduce repetition of common values, create
    predefined sets of parameters for end users, and to securely
    store credentials where needed. Each configuration is given a
    unique name that is entered in designated parameters on
    procedures that use them.<br />
    <br />
    Plugin configurations are created by going to the Electric
    Commander "Administration" tab, then to the "Plugins" sub-tab.
    On the right side of the line for the EC-Azure plugin, there is
    a "Configure" link which will open the Configuration page.</p>

    <p>Subscription ID must be created and an X.509 management
    certificate needs to be uploaded to the certificate store. You
    can do this using the <a href="https://www.windowsazure.com">Management Portal</a></p>
    <!-- For all parameters, the parameter name should be *exactly* the same as it appears in the
    Parameter Panel, and the first sentence(s) of the description should be
    the same as the tooltip (if there is one). After that, the parameter
    description can go into greater detail about the parameter including
    valid value ranges and examples.

    <h2>Use Case 1: Set Azure to create a new staging
    deployment.</h2>

    <p>A common use for this plugin is to create a hosted service,
    then create an storage account, create a container and a blob
    using and then create a deployment. To accomplish these tasks
    you must:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Create a Plugin Configuration.</li>

      <li>Create a Hosted Service.</li>

      <li>Create a Storage Account.</li>

      <li>Get the Storage Account Keys.</li>

      <li>Create a Container in the storage account.</li>

      <li>Upload the package file contains the application to
      deploy.</li>

      <li>Create the new deployment.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Create a Plugin Configuration</h4>

    <p>Plugin configurations are created by going to the Electric
    Commander "Administration" tab, then to the "Plugins" sub-tab.
    On the right side of the line for the EC-Azure plugin, there is
    a "Configure" link which will open the Configuration
    page.<br />
    Create a new configuration by specifying the requested
    parameters:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/create_config.png" />

    <p>Once the configuration is created, you can see it listed in
    "Windows Azure Configurations", and now you are able to run
    procedures.</p>

    <h4>Create a Hosted Service</h4>

    <p>Create a new 'Create Hosted Service' procedure, fill in the
    requested parameters with real values:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/hosted_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Create an Storage Account</h4>

    <p>Create a new 'Create Storage Account' procedure, fill in the
    requested parameters with real values:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/storage_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Get the Storage Account Keys</h4>

    <p>Create a new 'Get Storage Account Keys' procedure, fill in
    the requested parameters with real values:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/keys_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Create a Container</h4>

    <p>Create a new 'Create Container' procedure, fill in the
    requested parameters with real values:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/container_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Upload the File</h4>

    <p>Create a new 'Put Blob' procedure, fill in the requested
    parameters with real values:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/blob_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Create the Deployment</h4>

    <p>Create a new 'Create Deployment' procedure, fill in the
    requested parameters with real values:</p><img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/deployment_parameters.png" />

    <h4>Results and outputs</h4>

    <p>Once the job finished, you can see properties stored in
    'Results location: /myJob/Azure/deployed/'.<br />
    <img alt="" src="../../plugins/@PLUGIN_KEY@/images/use_cases/Case_1/job.png" /><br />
